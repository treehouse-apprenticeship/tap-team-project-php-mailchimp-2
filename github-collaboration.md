# TalentPath Team Capstone Project
Project to practice the basics of a Git &amp; GitHub workflow and debugging. 

## Getting Started:
* Clone this repository to your local machine. See [Clone a Repo Locally](https://github.com/treehouse-talentpath/git-checklists/blob/master/clone-a-repo-locally.md)
* Check the ISSUES tab in this repository to see if you've been assigned any issues. If you have skip to the next section. If you have no issues, wait for the Scrum Master to Assign them to you

## Handling an ISSUE
All of you will be responsible for solving two issues *NOT* tagged as "documentation" and *one* issue tagged as "documentation" per person. Because of the nature of errors/bugs one error will need to be resolved before the next issues/errors become apparent. You can find the basic process for handling a GitHub issue in this [Handling GitHub Issues](https://github.com/treehouse-talentpath/git-checklists/blob/master/handling-issues.md) doc.

* Create a GitHub Pull Request
    * Add and commit changes
    * Push to this repository
    * Issue a pull request and assign one of your other team members to perform "code review" and accept your pull request.

## Reviewing Code
You'll be assigned a pull request to review by one of your fellow students. 
* Go to GitHub and visit the repo for this project.
* Visit the Pull Request tab and click on the pull request you were assigned. Note the name of the branch.
* On your computer perform a `git fetch` to pull down the latest changes.
* Switch to the branch for that pull request.
* Open the other students file in your text editor. Did they add their name to the file? Hooray, their code has passed :)
* Go back to GitHub and accept the pull request and delete the other student's branch

## Handling Other Issues
You also have one other issue assigned for you to do. Once you've finished the first issue, complete the second issue using the same process.
